# **Risk Assessment Matrix: Priority Task Manager**

## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the potential risks identified for the 7-week project to implement a multi-agent prioritization system in the Priority Task Manager. The purpose of this matrix is to proactively identify, analyze, and prepare mitigation and contingency strategies to ensure the project's successful and timely completion. Each risk is assessed based on its likelihood of occurring and its potential impact on the project's timeline, scope, or quality.

## **2. Risk Matrix**

| ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
| :- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T1** | **Algorithm Complexity**<br>The prioritization formula in the `PrioritizationAgent` is difficult to balance, resulting in unintuitive or illogical task ordering that doesn't meet the project's core goal. | High | High | **Critical** | **TDD with Key Scenarios:** Develop specific unit tests for common use cases (e.g., "urgent but low-complexity" vs. "non-urgent but high-complexity").<br>**Start Simple:** Begin with a transparent, additive formula and iteratively add complexity.<br>**Configurable Weights:** Keep the weights for each agent's score in a easily accessible configuration spot for rapid tuning. | Revert to a simpler, more predictable formula for the final deliverable. The "single-agent" mode serves as a built-in fallback to guarantee a functional, if less intelligent, prioritization engine. |
| **PM1**| **Scope Creep**<br>The desire to add features beyond the defined core scope (e.g., trying to implement all stretch goals) jeopardizes the 7-week timeline. | Medium | High | **High** | **Strict Adherence to Plan:** Rigorously follow the defined weekly sprints and core feature list.<br>**Backlog Management:** Document all new ideas or feature requests in a separate "Post-Launch" list to avoid distraction.<br>**Weekly Review:** At the start of each week, review the goals to ensure they align with the core scope. | If a new feature is deemed absolutely essential, formally de-scope a core feature of equivalent effort. The primary goal is a finished, polished product within the timeframe. |
| **PM2**| **Schedule Slippage**<br>A sprint's deliverables take longer than the allotted week, causing a domino effect on the rest of the schedule. | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | **Granular Task Breakdown:** Break each weekly goal into a checklist of small, daily tasks.<br>**Front-Load Complexity:** The project plan intentionally places the most complex refactoring and agent logic in the earlier weeks.<br>**Efficient Tooling:** Leverage AI development tools to accelerate boilerplate and common code patterns. | If a sprint slips, immediately re-evaluate the scope of the *following* sprint to see if a lower-priority task can be simplified or postponed. The goal is to absorb delays without compromising the final deadline. |
| **T2** | **Refactoring Failure**<br>The foundational refactoring in Week 1 to introduce the `IUrgencyStrategy` interface introduces critical bugs that break existing, stable functionality. | Low | High | **Medium** | **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Rely on the existing xUnit test suite to serve as a safety net. All existing tests must pass before the refactoring is considered complete.<br>**Version Control:** Perform all refactoring on a dedicated Git branch to allow for easy review and the ability to revert completely if the changes are unstable. | Revert the branch using Git. Re-approach the refactoring with a less invasive method, or accept a tighter coupling as a temporary trade-off to maintain the schedule. |
| **T3** | **Unforeseen Critical Bugs**<br>A significant bug appears late in the development cycle (e.g., Week 6) that is difficult to diagnose and threatens a core feature, such as the mode-switching logic. | Low | Medium | **Low** | **Incremental Integration:** The weekly sprint plan is designed to integrate features as they are built, reducing the likelihood of a "big bang" integration failure at the end.<br>**Clean Code Practices:** Adherence to SOLID principles and the modular agent design makes the codebase easier to debug. | Isolate the buggy feature and disable it if a fix cannot be found in time. Deliver a functional project with the feature explicitly noted as "in-progress" rather than delivering a broken application. |
| **PM3**| **Tool Dependency**<br>The AI code generation tools (Copilot, Gemini) are unavailable or produce low-quality code, slowing down the development pace. | Low | Medium | **Low** | **Manual Proficiency:** Maintain proficiency in writing all code manually. The AI tools are accelerators, not crutches.<br>**Critical Review:** All AI-generated code must be thoroughly reviewed and understood before being committed to the codebase. | Revert to a fully manual coding workflow. The timeline has some buffer, but non-essential tasks (like extensive documentation) might be simplified to compensate for the reduced velocity. |
