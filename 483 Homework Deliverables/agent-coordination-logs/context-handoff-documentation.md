"How information flows between agents"

This project uses a cyclical coordination pattern where context flows not only down from strategy to implementation, but also back up from implementation to strategy.

### **The Forward Pass (Feature Implementation):**
1.  **Strategist -> Architect:** The Human Coordinator takes a feature prompts generated by Agent 1 (ChatGPT) and provides it to Agent 2 (Gemini).
2.  **Architect -> Implementer:** The Human Coordinator takes technical instruction prompts generated by Agent 2 (Gemini) and provides it to Agent 3 (Copilot).

### **The Backward Pass (Context Generation - The Feedback Loop):**
3.  **Implementer -> System:** Agent 3 (Copilot) completes the C# implementation based on the prompt.
4.  **System -> Strategist/Architect:** The Human Coordinator now prompts Agent 3 to document the new functionality or update.
5.  **Cycle Repeats:** This new summary document is now part of the context for Agent 1 and Agent 2 when designing the *next* feature, ensuring they are aware of the current, actual state of the codebase.
