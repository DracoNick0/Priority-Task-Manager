"Clear identification of each agent's specialization and responsibilities"

# Agent Coordination Log & Documentation

**Project:** Smart To-Do CLI Application
**Human Coordinator:** Nicholas Santos

The project is executed by a team of three specialized AI agents, orchestrated by a Human Coordinator in an iterative development cycle.

### **Note on Project Evolution and Initial Agent Structure**

Prior to the formal adoption of the three-agent structure required by this assignment, the initial planning, development, and creation of this project were conducted using a two-agent system.

*   **Agents Used:** Gemini and GitHub Copilot.
*   **Initial Responsibilities:** During this phase, **Gemini** fulfilled a consolidated role, acting as the **Product Strategist, System Architect, and Prompt Engineer**. It was responsible for idea generation, feature scoping, architectural design, and generating the detailed technical prompts for the implementer. **GitHub Copilot**'s role as the C# Implementation Specialist remained the same.

The current three-agent workflow, which separates the "Product Strategist" role into a dedicated agent (ChatGPT), represents the formal process adopted to meet the assignment's critical requirement of coordinating a minimum of three distinct AI agents.

### Agent 1: Product Strategist & Scoping Engineer
*   **AI Tool:** ChatGPT-4
*   **Specialization:** Brainstorming user-facing features and translating them into focused, actionable prompts for the System Architect.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Work with the Human Coordinator to break down the overall application vision into smaller, implementable features (e.g., "Add a Task", "Calculate Priority Score", "Display Sorted List").
    *   For a given feature, generate a clear, concise, and well-defined prompt that describes the *what* and the *why*.
    *   **Act as a Prompt Engineer for the Architect:** The output will be responses to questions, or organized prompts designed to be fed to Agent 2 (Gemini).

### Agent 2: System Architect & Technical Prompt Engineer
*   **AI Tool:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (or a more advanced version)
*   **Specialization:** Translating feature requirements into high-level C# application architecture (classes, methods, data structures) and then engineering detailed, code-level prompts for the Implementer.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Ingest the feature-specific prompts from Agent 1.
    *   Design the necessary C# class structures, method signatures, and logic flows for the given feature.
    *   **Act as a Prompt Engineer for the Implementer:** The primary output will be highly-detailed, structured prompts formatted to be sent directly to Agent 3 (GitHub Copilot), instructing it to program features.
    *   Ensure the designs are expandable for future features and application types.

### Agent 3: C# Implementation & Context Generation Specialist
*   **AI Tool:** GitHub Copilot
*   **Specialization:** Writing C# code based on in-editor context and generating documentation *from the codebase* to inform the other agents.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Write the functional C# code inside the IDE, following the detailed prompts and skeleton structures provided by Agent 2.
    *   **Provide Detailed Documentation and Context Summaries:** After a feature is implemented, the Human Coordinator will use Copilot (or another tool with its context) to generate detailed XML comments, method summaries, and even high-level markdown descriptions of the new code. This generated documentation becomes the "ground truth" of the application's current state.

### Lead Role: Human Coordinator
*   **Role:** Agile Project Manager, Lead Developer, and System Integrator.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Manage the iterative development loop for each feature.
    *   Author the initial high-level prompts for ChatGPT.
    *   Critically, manage the **bi-directional flow of context**: feeding prompts forward and feeding generated documentation backward.
    *   Resolve conflicts and make final architectural decisions.
