# Log Entry 3
## User Prompt
Act as my lead AI developer for our new project: a Priority Task Manager. Your primary goal is to build a highly scalable and testable application.
Core Architectural Principles:
Scalability: We will enforce a strict separation of concerns. All core business logic must be independent of the user interface (UI). We will start with a C# CLI, but the architecture must support a future transition to a Flutter GUI.
Test-Driven Development: This is our most important rule. For every piece of functionality you create, you must also create a corresponding set of unit tests. We will use a dedicated test project for this. Your workflow should always be:
Implement a new feature or logic in the core project.
Immediately create or update tests in the test project to validate that feature.
Logging:
Maintain a numbered log in copilot_log.md. For each of my prompts that changes the code, create a new entry with my verbatim prompt and a summary of your actions, including both the feature code and the test code you generated.
Project Summary (For Your Reference):
[Paste the full project summary document here]
Let's Begin: Your First Task
Your first task is to set up the project structure and create our first testable feature.
Create a Test Project: Add a new xUnit Test Project to our solution. Name it PriorityTaskManager.Tests.
Reference Core Logic: Ensure the PriorityTaskManager.Tests project has a project reference to the main Priority-Task-Manager project so it can test its code.
Create the Data Model: In the main project, create a new folder named Models. Inside it, define a C# class named TaskItem.cs with properties for the Core Attributes from the project summary (Importance, Due Date, etc.), using appropriate data types.
Create a Service: In the main project, create a new folder named Services. Inside it, define a class named TaskManagerService.cs. This service should manage a private list of TaskItem objects and have a public method void AddTask(TaskItem task).
Write the First Test: In the PriorityTaskManager.Tests project, create a test class TaskManagerServiceTests.cs. Add a test method named AddTask_ShouldIncreaseTaskCount. This test should:
Create an instance of TaskManagerService.
Add a new TaskItem.
Assert that the count of tasks within the service is now 1.
After completing all steps, create copilot_log.md and log this as the third entry.

### Copilot's Action
Set up the solution and project structure for Priority Task Manager:
- Created a class library for core logic and an xUnit test project.
- Added project references and solution entries.
- Implemented the TaskItem data model and TaskManagerService in the main project.
- Created the first unit test (AddTask_ShouldIncreaseTaskCount) in the test project to validate adding tasks.

Please add a CLI console project to your solution and set up a basic entry point.

### Copilot's Action
Created a new CLI console application project (PriorityTaskManager.CLI), added it to the solution, and referenced the core logic project. Updated Program.cs to demonstrate basic usage of TaskManagerService and TaskItem. Ran the CLI app to verify functionality.

# Log Entry 5
## User Prompt
Thank you for the setup. Our next goal is to implement the full set of CRUD operations in our `TaskManagerService`. We will follow our test-driven development rule.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Enhance the Model:**
	*   In `TaskItem.cs`, add a unique identifier property: `public int Id { get; set; }`. This is crucial for finding, updating, and deleting specific tasks.

2.  **Expand the Service:**
	*   In `TaskManagerService.cs`, add the following public methods:
		*   `IEnumerable<TaskItem> GetAllTasks()`: Returns a copy of the entire task list.
		*   `TaskItem GetTaskById(int id)`: Finds and returns a task by its `Id`. Should return `null` if not found.
		*   `bool UpdateTask(TaskItem updatedTask)`: Finds an existing task by its `Id` and updates its properties. Should return `true` on success and `false` if the task was not found.
		*   `bool DeleteTask(int id)`: Removes a task from the list by its `Id`. Should return `true` on success and `false` if the task was not found.
	*   You will also need to add a private field like `private int _nextId = 1;` and logic inside your `AddTask` method to assign and increment the `Id` for each new task.

3.  **Write Corresponding Tests:**
	*   In `TaskManagerServiceTests.cs`, add new test methods to verify the functionality of each method you just created:
		*   `GetTaskById_ShouldReturnCorrectTask_WhenTaskExists`
		*   `GetTaskById_ShouldReturnNull_WhenTaskDoesNotExist`
		*   `UpdateTask_ShouldChangeTaskProperties_WhenTaskExists`
		*   `DeleteTask_ShouldRemoveTaskFromList_WhenTaskExists`

4.  **Clean Up:**
	*   Deleted unused boilerplate files: `PriorityTaskManager/Class1.cs` and `PriorityTaskManager.Tests/UnitTest1.cs`.

### Copilot's Action
Enhanced the TaskItem model with a unique Id property. Implemented full CRUD operations in TaskManagerService, including GetAllTasks, GetTaskById, UpdateTask, and DeleteTask, with unique Id assignment. Added comprehensive unit tests for all CRUD methods in TaskManagerServiceTests. Removed unused boilerplate files from both projects. All tests passed successfully.

# Log Entry 6
## User Prompt
With the core service logic in place, our next task is to create an interactive user interface in the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project. This will allow us to manually test the CRUD operations we've implemented.

**Your Task:**

Refactor the `Program.cs` file in the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project to create a menu-driven application.

1.  **Instantiate the Service:**
	*   At the beginning of the `Main` method, create a single instance of `TaskManagerService`. This instance will be passed to the methods that need it.

2.  **Create the Main Loop:**
	*   Implement a `while` loop that runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.
	*   Inside the loop, first display the menu of options, then wait for the user's input.

3.  **Implement Menu Logic:**
	*   Use a `switch` statement to handle the user's menu choice.
	*   The menu should present the following options:
		1.  Add a New Task
		2.  View All Tasks
		3.  Update an Existing Task
		4.  Delete a Task
		5.  Exit

4.  **Create Helper Methods:**
	*   To keep the `Main` method clean, create separate `private static` methods for each menu option's functionality (e.g., `HandleAddTask`, `HandleViewAllTasks`, etc.).

5.  **Implement Functionality for Each Option:**
	*   **Add Task:** Prompt the user for a `Title`, `Description`, and `Importance`. Create a new `TaskItem` object, pass it to the service's `AddTask` method, and print a success message.
	*   **View All Tasks:** Call the service's `GetAllTasks` method. If there are no tasks, print a message saying so. Otherwise, loop through the tasks and print the `Id`, `Title`, `Description`, and `IsCompleted` status for each one in a readable format.
	*   **Update Task:** Prompt the user for the `Id` of the task to update. Ask for the new `Title` and `Description`. Call the `UpdateTask` method and inform the user if the update was successful or if the task was not found.
	*   **Delete Task:** Prompt the user for the `Id` of the task to delete. Call the service's `DeleteTask` method and inform the user if the deletion was successful or if the task was not found.
	*   **Exit:** Cause the main loop to terminate, printing a "Goodbye!" message.

### Copilot's Action
Refactored Program.cs in PriorityTaskManager.CLI to implement a menu-driven interactive CLI for manual CRUD testing. Added helper methods for each menu option and ensured clean separation of logic. The CLI now allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks interactively.

# Log Entry 7
## User Prompt
Excellent progress. Our next task is to enhance the task model and add a key piece of functionality: marking tasks as complete. We will also refactor the `Importance` scale to be more granular. As always, we will follow our test-driven development workflow.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Refactor the Task Model (`TaskItem.cs`):**
	*   Delete the `ImportanceLevel` enum entirely.
	*   Change the `Importance` property in the `TaskItem` class from type `ImportanceLevel` to `int`.

2.  **Add New Service Logic (`TaskManagerService.cs`):**
	*   Create a new public method: `bool MarkTaskAsComplete(int id)`.
	*   This method should find the task by its `Id` and set its `IsCompleted` property to `true`. It should return `true` on success and `false` if the task is not found.

3.  **Update and Add Tests (`TaskManagerServiceTests.cs`):**
	*   Update all existing test methods that use `ImportanceLevel` to use integer values for `Importance`.
	*   Add a new test method: `MarkTaskAsComplete_ShouldSetIsCompletedToTrue_WhenTaskExists`.

4.  **Update the CLI (`Program.cs`):**
	*   Modify "Add Task" to prompt for importance (1-10) and validate input.
	*   Modify "Update Task" to allow updating importance (1-10).
	*   Add "Complete Task" functionality with a new menu option and handler.

### Copilot's Action
Refactored the TaskItem model to use an int for Importance and removed the enum. Added MarkTaskAsComplete to the service. Updated all tests for the new model and added a test for marking tasks complete. Enhanced the CLI to support granular importance, updating importance, and marking tasks as complete. All tests pass successfully.

# Log Entry 8
## User Prompt
Implement dynamic urgency calculation based on dependencies and deadlines. The urgency score for each task should reflect how soon it must be started, considering all downstream dependencies and their deadlines. The calculation must ensure that the first task in a dependency chain is the most urgent, and urgency should decrease as you move down the chain. Integrate this logic into the CLI and ensure strict TDD: every feature must have corresponding unit tests that validate the dependency-aware urgency calculation.

### Copilot's Action
- Refactored the data model (`TaskItem.cs`) to support dependency chains and urgency attributes.
- Implemented recursive urgency calculation in `TaskManagerService.cs`, ensuring the first task in a dependency chain is most urgent.
- Updated the CLI to display urgency and LPSD for all tasks, sorted by urgency.
- Added and validated unit tests in `TaskManagerServiceTests.cs` to confirm correct urgency ordering for dependency chains.
- Debugged and iterated on the calculation logic until all tests passed, confirming robust dependency-aware prioritization.

## User Prompt
We are performing a major overhaul of the Command-Line Interface to make it significantly faster, more intuitive, and more user-friendly. This will involve replacing the numeric menu with a modern command-and-argument system and implementing an advanced, interactive editor for date inputs.

**Your Task:**

**Part 1: Implement a New Command Parser**
*   In `Program.cs`, remove the main `while` loop that displays a numbered menu.
*   Replace it with a new loop that reads a full line of user input (e.g., "add My new task").
*   Split the input into a command (the first word) and an array of arguments (the rest).
*   Use a `switch` statement on the command string to call the appropriate handler methods.

**Part 2: Overhaul the "Add Task" Workflow**
*   The new command will be: `add <Title>`. The title is the only required part of the initial command.
*   Refactor the `HandleAddTask` method to accept the title from the command arguments.
*   For all other attributes **except the Due Date**, prompt the user individually but allow them to **press Enter (providing an empty input) to accept a default value.**
    *   **Defaults:** Description (`string.Empty`), Importance (`5`), Estimated Duration (`TimeSpan.FromHours(1)`), Progress (`0.0`), Dependencies (empty list).
*   **For the Due Date prompt, you will implement a special interactive editor:**
    *   Create a new `private static` helper method: `DateTime HandleInteractiveDateInput(DateTime initialDate)`.
    *   This method should display the current date and time, allowing the user to increment or decrement the year, month, day, hour, and minute using the arrow keys.
    *   Pressing Enter should confirm the selected date and time, while Escape should cancel and return to the previous menu.

**Part 3: Revamp the "View All Tasks" Display**
*   In the `HandleViewAllTasks` method, enhance the output to show the urgency and LPSD for each task, in addition to the existing details.
*   Ensure that the tasks are sorted by urgency, with the most urgent task displayed first.

**Part 4: Integrate the Date Editor into "Add Task" and "Update Task"**
*   **Refactor `HandleAddTask` (`Program.cs`):**
    *   After prompting for all other attributes, add a new prompt: "Press 'd' to edit the due date, or any other key to skip."
    *   If the user presses 'd', call the `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method.
    *   Update the new task object with the date returned from the interactive editor.
*   **Refactor `HandleUpdateTask` (`Program.cs`):**
    *   After the user has updated the other properties, add a new prompt: "Press 'd' to edit the due date, or any other key to skip."
    *   If the user presses 'd', call the `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method.
    *   You must pass the task's *existing* due date (`existingTask.DueDate`) as the `initialDate` argument to the method.
    *   Update the `updatedTask` object with the new date returned from the interactive editor.

After implementing all of these enhancements, please update the `copilot_log.md` with a new entry for this prompt.

### Copilot's Action
- Implemented a new command parser in Program.cs, replacing the numeric menu with a command-and-argument system.
- Overhauled the "Add Task" workflow to use command arguments and interactive prompts with default values.
- Developed a special interactive date editor for precise date and time input.
- Revamped the "View All Tasks" display to include urgency and LPSD, sorted by urgency.
- Integrated the date editor into "Add Task" and "Update Task" workflows for live due date editing.
- All changes validated by passing unit tests and manual CLI testing.

# Log Entry 10
## User Prompt
We are continuing our major overhaul of the CLI. This update will enhance our new interactive date editor with more powerful controls, integrate it into the "update" workflow, and refine our core urgency logic.

**Your Task:**

**Part 1: Refine Core Logic and Tests**
*   **Modify Urgency Calculation (`TaskManagerService.cs`):**
    *   In the `CalculateUrgencyForAllTasks` method, add a rule at the very beginning of the logic for each task: If a task's `IsCompleted` property is `true`, its `UrgencyScore` should be immediately set to `0`. The rest of the urgency calculation (LPSD, etc.) should be skipped for that task.
*   **Update Tests (`TaskManagerServiceTests.cs`):**
    *   Create a new test method: `CalculateUrgency_ShouldBeZero_ForCompletedTask`.
    *   This test should create a task, set `IsCompleted` to `true`, run the urgency calculation, and then **Assert** that the task's `UrgencyScore` is `0`.

**Part 2: Create the Advanced Interactive Date Editor**
*   **Enhance `HandleInteractiveDateInput` (`Program.cs`):**
    *   Inside this method, introduce a state variable to track the current increment mode (an `enum` for Day, Week, Month, Year is perfect for this).
    *   **Crucially, initialize this mode variable to `Day` at the beginning of the method.** This ensures the editor always defaults to day-by-day navigation every time it is opened.
    *   Update the console display within the loop to show the current mode to the user, for example: `[Mode: Day] yyyy-MM-dd dddd`.
    *   Expand the `switch` statement for `Console.ReadKey(true)` to handle the new mode-switching keys:
        *   **Case `'d'**: Set the mode to Day.
        *   **Case `'w'**: Set the mode to Week.
        *   **Case `'m'**: Set the mode to Month.
        *   **Case `'y'**: Set the mode to Year.
    *   Modify the logic for the `LeftArrow` and `RightArrow` keys. They should now check the current mode to determine how much to change the date:
        *   If mode is Day, add/subtract 1 day.
        *   If mode is Week, add/subtract 7 days.
        *   If mode is Month, use `.AddMonths(1)` / `.AddMonths(-1)`.
        *   If mode is Year, use `.AddYears(1)` / `.AddYears(-1)`.
    *   Pressing Enter should confirm the selected date and time, while Escape should cancel and return to the previous menu.

**Part 3: Integrate Date Editor into "Update Task" Workflow**
*   **Refactor `HandleUpdateTask` (`Program.cs`):**
    *   After the user has updated the other properties, add a new prompt: "Press 'd' to edit the due date, or any other key to skip."
    *   If the user presses 'd', call the `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method.
    *   You must pass the task's *existing* due date (`existingTask.DueDate`) as the `initialDate` argument to the method.
    *   Update the `updatedTask` object with the new date returned from the interactive editor.

After completing these tasks, please update the `copilot_log.md` with a new entry for this prompt.

### Copilot's Action
- Refined urgency calculation logic to immediately set UrgencyScore to 0 for completed tasks.
- Enhanced interactive date editor to default to day-by-day navigation, with mode-switching keys for flexible date adjustment.
- Integrated advanced date editor into "Update Task" workflow for seamless due date editing.
- All changes validated by passing unit tests and manual CLI testing.

One more thing before we commit.

We need to make a couple of usability improvements to our command handling in the CLI.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Make Commands Case-Insensitive:**
    *   In `Program.cs`, locate where you read the user's input and split it into a command.
    *   Before the `switch` statement, convert the extracted command string to lowercase (e.g., using `.ToLower()`). This will ensure that "ADD", "add", and "Add" are all treated as the same command.

2.  **Rename the "update" Command to "edit":**
    *   In the `switch` statement, change the case from `case "update":` to `case "edit":`.
    *   In the `help` command's output text, update the description for this command to show `edit <Id>` instead of `update <Id>`.

After making these changes, please update the `copilot_log.md` with a new entry for this prompt.

### Copilot's Action
- Made all CLI commands case-insensitive for improved usability.
- Renamed the "update" command to "edit" throughout the CLI and help text.
- Updated the copilot log to document these usability improvements.

Great, thanks for doing that!
The current application is now feature-complete for its initial version, but it lacks data persistence. Our next and most critical task is to save all tasks to a file so that the user's data is not lost when the application is closed. We will use the modern, built-in `System.Text.Json` library for this.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Implement Save/Load Logic in the Service (`TaskManagerService.cs`):**
    *   Add a `private readonly string _filePath` field to store the path for our data file (e.g., `"tasks.json"`).
    *   Create a `private void SaveTasks()` method. This method will serialize the `_tasks` list and the `_nextId` field into a JSON file at `_filePath`. To save both, you might want to create a small helper class or use a `Tuple`.
    *   Create a `private void LoadTasks()` method. This method will check if `_filePath` exists. If it does, it will read the JSON file, deserialize the data, and populate the `_tasks` list and `_nextId` field. It should handle the case where the file does not exist (by simply doing nothing and letting the service start with a fresh, empty list).
    *   Call `LoadTasks()` at the end of the `TaskManagerService` constructor.

2.  **Integrate Saving into All Modifying Methods:**
    *   At the end of **every public method** that changes the list of tasks, add a call to `SaveTasks()`. This includes:
        *   `AddTask`
        *   `UpdateTask`
        *   `DeleteTask`
        *   `MarkTaskAsComplete`

3.  **Perform Project Cleanup:**
    *   The project structure looks great, but there is an unused boilerplate file. Please delete the `PriorityTaskManager.Tests/UnitTest1.cs` file.

After implementing data persistence, please update the `copilot_log.md` with a new entry for this prompt.

### Copilot's Action
- Implemented data persistence in `TaskManagerService` using `System.Text.Json`.
  - Added `SaveTasks` and `LoadTasks` methods.
  - Integrated `SaveTasks` into all modifying methods (`AddTask`, `UpdateTask`, `DeleteTask`, `MarkTaskAsComplete`).
  - Ensured tasks are loaded from `tasks.json` during service initialization.
- Deleted the unused `UnitTest1.cs` file from the test project.

We are making several user experience improvements to the CLI to streamline common workflows and enhance readability.

**Your Task:**

**Part 1: Streamlining Task Creation (`HandleAddTask`)**
*   In the `HandleAddTask` method, remove the user prompts for `Progress` and `Dependencies`.
*   These properties should be set to their default values (0.0 for Progress, and an empty list for Dependencies) automatically when a new `TaskItem` is created.

**Part 2: Enhancing the Task List View (`HandleViewAllTasks`)**
*   Modify the `foreach` loop that displays the tasks to change the display format.
*   Instead of showing `Completed: True/False`, display a checkbox at the beginning of the line: `[x]` for completed tasks and `[ ]` for incomplete tasks.
*   Remove the `Description` from the list view to make it more compact.
*   The new format should look something like this:
    `[ ] Id: 2, Title: My new task, Urgency: 0.850, LPSD: 2025-08-28`

**Part 3: Overhauling the `edit` Command (`Program.cs`)**
*   **A. Simplify Due Date Editing:**
    *   In `HandleUpdateTask`, remove the prompt that asks the user to press 'd' to edit the due date.
    *   The interactive date editor (`HandleInteractiveDateInput`) should now be a standard part of the full edit process, appearing automatically after the other prompts.

*   **B. Implement Targeted Attribute Editing:**
    *   We will modify the `edit` command to accept an optional third argument specifying which attribute to edit.
    *   Update the logic in the main `switch` statement for the `edit` case to handle this new argument pattern.
    *   Refactor `HandleUpdateTask` to accept this optional attribute name.
    *   Inside `HandleUpdateTask`, use a `switch` on the attribute name (passed in as lowercase).
        *   If an attribute name is provided, prompt the user *only* for that specific attribute's new value.
        *   If no attribute name is provided, the method should proceed with the full, multi-prompt edit as it does now.
    *   Support the following attribute names: `title`, `desc`, `importance`, `due`, `progress`, and `duration`.

After implementing all of these UX improvements, please update the `copilot_log.md` with a new entry for this prompt.

### Copilot's Action
- Streamlined the `HandleAddTask` method by removing prompts for `Progress` and `Dependencies`, setting them to default values.
- Enhanced the `HandleViewAllTasks` method to display tasks with a checkbox for completion status and removed the `Description` field for a more compact view.

Hello Copilot. We are beginning a multi-part refactoring of our `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project to implement a Command Handler Pattern. This will improve the structure and scalability of the code.

In this first part, we will create the foundational interface and directory structure.

### **Step 1: Create the Command Handler Interface**

1.  In the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project, create a new folder named `Interfaces`.
2.  Inside this new `Interfaces` folder, create a new C# interface file named `ICommandHandler.cs`.
3.  Add the following code to the `ICommandHandler.cs` file. This interface defines the contract that all of our future command handler classes will follow.

    ```csharp
    using PriorityTaskManager.Services;

    namespace PriorityTaskManager.CLI.Interfaces
    {
        public interface ICommandHandler
        {
            void Execute(TaskManagerService service, string[] args);
        }
    }
    ```

### **Step 2: Create the Handlers Directory**

1.  In the root of the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project, create a new, empty folder named `Handlers`. We will populate this directory with our handler classes in the next steps.

# Log Entry 19

## User Prompt

Hello Copilot. We are continuing our refactoring to a Command Handler Pattern. In this step, we will create and implement the handlers for our simpler, self-contained commands: `help`, `delete`, `complete`, and `uncomplete`.

**Important:** You must create new handler classes and move the logic from the existing `Program.cs` methods into them. Do **not** delete the original methods from `Program.cs` yet.

### **Step 1: Implement the `HelpHandler`**

1.  In the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers` directory, create a new class file named `HelpHandler.cs`.
2.  The class must implement `ICommandHandler`.
3.  Move the entire logic of the `PrintHelp()` method from `Program.cs` into the `Execute` method of this new handler.

### **Step 2: Implement the `DeleteHandler`**

1.  In the `Handlers` directory, create a new class file named `DeleteHandler.cs`.
2.  The class must implement `ICommandHandler`.
3.  Move the entire logic of the `HandleDeleteTask(TaskManagerService service, int id)` method from `Program.cs` into the `Execute` method of this new handler, ensuring the `id` is correctly parsed from the `args` array.

### **Step 3: Implement the `CompleteHandler`**

1.  In the `Handlers` directory, create a new class file named `CompleteHandler.cs`.
2.  The class must implement `ICommandHandler`.
3.  Move the entire logic of the `HandleMarkTaskAsComplete(TaskManagerService service, int id)` method from `Program.cs` into the `Execute` method of this new handler, ensuring the `id` is correctly parsed from the `args` array.

### **Step 4: Implement the `UncompleteHandler`**

1.  In the `Handlers` directory, create a new class file named `UncompleteHandler.cs`.
2.  The class must implement `ICommandHandler`.
3.  Move the entire logic of the `HandleMarkTaskAsIncomplete(TaskManagerService service, int id)` method from `Program.cs` into the `Execute` method of this new handler, ensuring the `id` is correctly parsed from the `args` array.

### Copilot's Action

1. Created `HelpHandler.cs` in the `Handlers` directory and moved the logic from `PrintHelp()` into the `Execute` method.

## User Prompt

Hello Copilot. We are ready for the next stage of our Command Handler refactoring. We will now create handlers for the more complex commands: `list`, `add`, and `edit`.

**Important:** As before, you will only be creating new files and moving/copying logic into them. Do **not** delete the original methods or the private enum from `Program.cs` yet.

### **Step 1: Implement the `ListHandler`**

1.  In the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers` directory, create a new class file named `ListHandler.cs`.
2.  The class must implement `ICommandHandler`.
3.  Move the entire logic from the `HandleViewAllTasks` method in `Program.cs` into the `Execute` method of this new handler.

### **Step 2: Implement the `AddHandler`**

This handler requires its own private helper method for date input.

1.  In the `Handlers` directory, create a new class file named `AddHandler.cs`.
2.  The class must implement `ICommandHandler`.
3.  Move the entire logic from the `HandleAddTask` method in `Program.cs` into the `Execute` method.
4.  Find the `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method and its private `IncrementMode` enum in `Program.cs`. Move **both** of them into the `AddHandler.cs` file and declare them as `private` members of the `AddHandler` class. The `Execute` method should now call this local private method for date input.

### **Step 3: Implement the `EditHandler`**

This handler is the most complex, as it orchestrates both full and targeted edits and also requires the date input logic.

1.  In the `Handlers` directory, create a new class file named `EditHandler.cs`.
2.  The class must implement `ICommandHandler`.
3.  The main `Execute` method's logic should be taken from the `HandleUpdateTask` method in `Program.cs`. This method acts as the entry point, parsing the arguments to decide which type of edit to perform.
4.  Move the logic from the `HandleTargetedUpdate` method in `Program.cs` into a new `private` method within the `EditHandler` class. The `Execute` method should call this private helper for targeted attribute edits.
5.  The `EditHandler` also needs the interactive date picker. Copy the `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method and the `IncrementMode` enum from `Program.cs` and place them inside the `EditHandler` class as `private` members.

### Copilot's Action

1. Created `ListHandler.cs` in the `Handlers` directory and moved the logic from `HandleViewAllTasks` into the `Execute` method.
2. Created `AddHandler.cs` in the `Handlers` directory and moved the logic from `HandleAddTask` into the `Execute` method. Also moved the `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method and `IncrementMode` enum as private members of the `AddHandler` class.
3. Created `EditHandler.cs` in the `Handlers` directory and moved the logic from `HandleUpdateTask` into the `Execute` method. Added a private `HandleTargetedUpdate` method for targeted edits. Also moved the `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method and `IncrementMode` enum as private members of the `EditHandler

## User Prompt

Hello Copilot. We have successfully created handlers for all our commands. In this crucial step, we will refactor the `Main` method in `Program.cs` to use our new Command Handler Pattern. This will replace the large `switch` statement with a clean, dictionary-based dispatcher.

### **Step 1: Update `Program.cs` to Use Handlers**

1.  Open the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Program.cs` file.
2.  Add the necessary `using` statements at the top of the file to access our new handlers and interface:
    ```csharp
    using PriorityTaskManager.CLI.Handlers;
    using PriorityTaskManager.CLI.Interfaces;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    ```
3.  Inside the `Main` method, just after the `TaskManagerService` is created, define a `Dictionary` that maps the command strings (e.g., "add", "list") to instances of their corresponding handler classes.
4.  Replace the entire `while` loop, including the old `switch` statement, with a new loop. This new loop will parse the user's command and use the dictionary to find and `Execute` the correct handler. If the command is "exit", the loop should terminate.

### **Step 2: Remove Obsolete Methods**

1.  Now that the `switch` statement is gone, all of the old `Handle...` and `PrintHelp` methods in `Program.cs` are no longer being called.
2.  Delete the following methods entirely from `Program.cs`:
    *   `HandleAddTask`
    *   `HandleViewAllTasks`
    *   `HandleUpdateTask`
    *   `HandleTargetedUpdate`
    *   `HandleDeleteTask`
    *   `HandleMarkTaskAsComplete`
    *   `HandleMarkTaskAsIncomplete`
    *   `PrintHelp`
3.  The `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method and its private `IncrementMode` enum should have been moved to the `AddHandler` and `EditHandler` classes in the previous step, so they should already be gone from `Program.cs`. If they are still present, delete them now.

After these changes, your `Program.cs` file should be significantly smaller and contain only the `Main` method with the new handler-dispatching logic.

### Copilot's Action

1. Refactored the `Main` method in `Program.cs` to use the Command Handler Pattern with a dictionary-based dispatcher.
2. Added the necessary `using` statements to access the handlers and interface.
3. Removed all obsolete methods from `Program.cs`, including `HandleAddTask`, `HandleViewAllTasks`, `HandleUpdateTask`, `HandleTargetedUpdate`, `HandleDeleteTask`, `HandleMarkTaskAsComplete`, `HandleMarkTaskAsIncomplete`, and `PrintHelp`.
4. Verified the functionality of the refactored CLI by running the application and testing various

# Log Entry 22

## User Prompt

Hello Copilot. We are on the final step of our Command Handler refactoring. We have successfully moved all command logic into dedicated handler classes. However, this has created code duplication: both `AddHandler.cs` and `EditHandler.cs` now contain an identical `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method.

Our goal is to eliminate this duplication by moving the shared logic into a static helper class.

### **Step 1: Create a Console Input Helper Class**

1.  In the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project, create a new folder named `Utils`.
2.  Inside the `Utils` folder, create a new C# class file named `ConsoleInputHelper.cs`.
3.  Make this a `public static` class.

### **Step 2: Move the Shared Logic**

1.  Go to `AddHandler.cs`. Cut the entire `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method and the `IncrementMode` enum from this file.
2.  Paste both the method and the enum into the new `ConsoleInputHelper.cs` class.
3.  In `ConsoleInputHelper.cs`, make the `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method `public static`. The `IncrementMode` enum should also be `public`.

### **Step 3: Update Handlers to Use the Helper**

Now, we need to update the two handlers that relied on this logic.

1.  **Refactor `AddHandler.cs`:**
    *   The local `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method and `IncrementMode` enum should now be gone.
    *   Find the line where the date input was called and change it to call the new static method: `ConsoleInputHelper.HandleInteractiveDateInput(...)`.
    *   Add a `using PriorityTaskManager.CLI.Utils;` statement at the top of the file if needed.

2.  **Refactor `EditHandler.cs`:**
    *   Delete the private `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method and the `IncrementMode` enum from this file.
    *   Find the line(s) where the date input was called and change them to call the new static method: `ConsoleInputHelper.HandleInteractiveDateInput(...)`.
    *   Add a `using PriorityTaskManager.CLI.Utils;` statement at the top of the file if needed.

Once this is complete, our refactoring will be finished. The CLI project will have a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture with no duplicated code.

### Copilot's Action

1. Created a new `Utils` folder and added the `ConsoleInputHelper.cs` static helper class.
2. Moved the shared `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method and `IncrementMode` enum into `ConsoleInputHelper.cs` as public static members.
3. Refactored both `AddHandler.cs` and `EditHandler.cs` to use the new helper method and removed the duplicated code.
4. Verified that the CLI runs successfully and all commands work as expected.

Hello Copilot. We are beginning the second phase of our solution cleanup: improving code readability. We will start with the **`PriorityTaskManager`** project.

Your task is to add vertical whitespace (blank lines) to make the code easier to read. Please review the following files:
*   `Models/TaskItem.cs`
*   `Services/TaskManagerService.cs`

In each file, please perform these actions:

1.  **Group Properties:** In `TaskItem.cs`, ensure there is a blank line separating the block of properties from any methods, if applicable.

2.  **Separate Logical Blocks in Methods:** Within each method in `TaskManagerService.cs`, add blank lines to separate distinct logical sections. For example:
    *   Separate variable declaration/initialization blocks from the main processing logic.
    *   Separate the main logic from the final `return` statement.
    *   If a method has multiple distinct steps (e.g., "find the item," then "update its properties," then "save"), place a blank line between each step.

The goal is to break up dense blocks of code and create a clear visual flow, not to add a line between every single statement.

### Copilot's Action

- Added vertical whitespace to TaskItem.cs and TaskManagerService.cs in the PriorityTaskManager project to improve code readability.
- Grouped properties and separated them from methods in TaskItem.cs.
- Added blank lines to separate logical blocks within methods in TaskManagerService.cs, making the code easier

Hello Copilot. We are continuing with the second phase of our cleanup, focusing on code readability. The next target is the **`PriorityTaskManager.CLI`** project.

Your task is to review every `.cs` file in this project and add vertical whitespace (blank lines) to improve the visual structure and flow.

Please review all of the following files:
*   `Program.cs`
*   `Interfaces/ICommandHandler.cs`
*   `Handlers/AddHandler.cs`
*   `Handlers/CompleteHandler.cs`
*   `Handlers/DeleteHandler.cs`

*   `Handlers/HelpHandler.cs`
*   `Handlers/ListHandler.cs`
*   `Handlers/UncompleteHandler.cs`
*   `Utils/ConsoleInputHelper.cs`

For each file, apply these principles:

1.  **Separate Methods:** Ensure there is at least one blank line between the closing brace `}` of one method and the opening signature of the next.

2.  **Separate Logical Blocks in Methods:** This is the most important step. Within each method, add blank lines to separate distinct logical sections. For example:
    *   In the `Execute` methods, separate the argument parsing/validation logic from the main action.
    *   In the `AddHandler` and `EditHandler`, separate each `Console.Write`/`Console.ReadLine` block for different properties.
    *   In `ConsoleInputHelper`, separate the `while` loop from the initial variable declarations.

The objective is to make the code less dense and guide the reader's eye through the logical steps of each method.

### Copilot's Action

- Added vertical whitespace to all specified `.cs` files in the PriorityTaskManager.CLI project.
- Ensured methods are separated by blank lines and logical blocks within methods are visually distinct.
- Improved code readability and maintainability throughout the CLI project.

Your task is to apply two main principles to the file:

1.  **Separate Test Methods:** Ensure there is at least one blank line separating each distinct test method (each method marked with `[Fact]`).

2.  **Structure Tests with "Arrange, Act, Assert" (AAA):** The code in our tests already follows the AAA pattern. Your job is to make this pattern visually explicit. Within each test method, add a blank line between:
    *   The **Arrange** section (where you set up the service and data).
    *   The **Act** section (where you call the method being tested).
    *   The **Assert** section (where you verify the outcome).

This will make the purpose and flow of each test immediately obvious to anyone reading the file.

### Copilot's Action

- Added vertical whitespace to `TaskManagerServiceTests.cs` to separate each test method.
- Made the "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern visually explicit within each test by adding blank lines between sections.
- Improved the clarity and readability of all unit tests

### **1. Document the Command Handler Interface**

Open `Interfaces/ICommandHandler.cs` and add documentation:
*   Add a `<summary>` to the `ICommandHandler` interface explaining its purpose (the contract for all command handlers).
*   Add a `<summary>` and `<param>` tags for the `Execute` method, explaining its role and what the `service` and `args` parameters are for.

### **2. Document All Handler Classes**

For every class in the `Handlers` directory (`AddHandler.cs`, `ListHandler.cs`, etc.), perform the following:
*   Add a `<summary>` to the class itself, clearly stating which user command it is responsible for (e.g., "Handles the 'add' command...").
*   The `Execute` method in each handler should already inherit the documentation from the interface. If your IDE shows it, you don't need to add it again. If not, add the documentation block to the `Execute` method.

### **3. Document the Console Input Helper**

Open `Utils/ConsoleInputHelper.cs` and add documentation:
*   Add a `<summary>` to the static `ConsoleInputHelper` class describing its role (providing shared console input functionality).
*   Add a full documentation block to the `HandleInteractiveDateInput` method, including a `<summary>`, a `<param>` for `initialDate`, and a `<returns>` tag describing the `DateTime` object that is returned.
*   Add a `<summary>` to the `IncrementMode` enum.

We need to enforce a new business rule: a task's title cannot be null, empty, or consist only of whitespace. We will follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, starting by writing tests that will initially fail.

### **Step 1: Create Failing Unit Tests**

Open the test file `PriorityTaskManager.Tests/TaskManagerServiceTests.cs`. Your task is to add two new test methods to validate our new rule.

1.  **Create a test for the `AddTask` method.**
    *   Name the method `AddTask_ShouldThrowArgumentException_WhenTitleIsEmpty`.
    *   Inside, arrange to create a `TaskItem` with a null or empty string for its title.
    *   Act and Assert by confirming that calling `service.AddTask` with this invalid task correctly throws an `ArgumentException`.

2.  **Create a test for the `UpdateTask` method.**
    *   Name the method `UpdateTask_ShouldThrowArgumentException_WhenTitleIsEmpty`.
    *   Inside, arrange by adding a valid task to the service first. Then, modify that task object by setting its title to a null or empty string.
    *   Act and Assert by confirming that calling `service.UpdateTask` with this invalid task correctly throws an `ArgumentException`.

After adding these tests, confirm that they fail as expected before proceeding.

### **Step 2: Implement the Validation Logic**

Now, make the failing tests pass by adding validation to our core data model.

1.  Open the model file `PriorityTaskManager/Models/TaskItem.cs`.
2.  Locate the public `Title` property.
3.  Convert the existing auto-property into a full property with a private backing field.
4.  In the `set` accessor of the new `Title` property, add validation logic. This logic must check if the incoming value is null, empty, or whitespace. If it is, the setter must throw a new `ArgumentException`.
5.  Ensure the `Title` property is no longer nullable.

After implementing this change, run all unit tests again. The two new tests should now pass.

### Copilot's Action

- Added two new unit tests to `TaskManagerServiceTests.cs` to enforce the business rule that a task's title cannot be null, empty, or whitespace.
- Implemented validation logic in the `TaskItem` model to throw an `ArgumentException` if the title is invalid.
- Updated the tests to professionally assert the expected exception.
- Modified the test for task count to ensure a clean state before execution.
- Updated the service to handle deserialization errors gracefully.
- Verified that all unit tests now pass, confirming robust enforcement of the new business rule.

We are beginning to implement task dependencies. Our first and most critical task is to prevent users from creating circular dependencies within the `TaskManagerService`. We will use TDD to build this feature, ensuring we cover both direct and multi-level (transitive) cycles.

### **Step 1: Write Failing Tests for Circular Dependencies**

Open the test file `PriorityTaskManager.Tests/TaskManagerServiceTests.cs`. Your task is to add two new unit tests that prove our system is currently vulnerable to circular dependencies. These tests should fail initially.

1.  **Create a test for a DIRECT circular dependency.**
    *   Name the method `UpdateTask_ShouldThrowInvalidOperationException_WhenDirectCircularDependencyIsCreated`.
    *   **Arrange:** Create and add two tasks, `taskA` and `taskB`. Make `taskB` depend on `taskA` and update it. Then, attempt to make `taskA` depend on `taskB`.
    *   **Act & Assert:** Assert that calling `service.UpdateTask(taskA)` throws an `InvalidOperationException`.

2.  **Create a test for a TRANSITIVE circular dependency.**
    *   Name the method `UpdateTask_ShouldThrowInvalidOperationException_WhenTransitiveCircularDependencyIsCreated`.
    *   **Arrange:** Create and add three tasks: `taskA`, `taskB`, and `taskC`. Create a dependency chain by making `taskC` depend on `taskB`, and `taskB` depend on `taskA`. Update both tasks. Finally, attempt to make `taskA` depend on `taskC`, which would complete the `A -> C -> B -> A` cycle.
    *   **Act & Assert:** Assert that calling `service.UpdateTask(taskA)` throws an `InvalidOperationException`.

### **Step 2: Implement the Detection Logic**

Now, modify the service to make both failing tests pass.

1.  **Open `PriorityTaskManager/Services/TaskManagerService.cs`.**
2.  **Create a private helper method** for detecting cycles. It should take a task object and a list of its proposed new dependencies as input, and return `true` if adding these dependencies would create a cycle.
3.  **Implement the cycle detection algorithm.** The algorithm must be able to traverse a multi-level dependency graph. Starting from each proposed dependency, recursively trace its dependencies, and its dependencies' dependencies, and so on. If you ever encounter the original task's ID during this traversal, you have found a cycle.
4.  **Integrate the check into `UpdateTask`**. Before saving the changes to a task, use your new private method to check if the proposed dependencies would create a cycle.
5.  **Throw the exception.** If the cycle detection method returns `true`, `UpdateTask` must throw a new `InvalidOperationException` with a clear error message. Otherwise, the update can proceed.

After completing these steps, run all unit tests. The two new tests should now pass.

### Copilot's Action

- Added two new failing unit tests to `TaskManagerServiceTests.cs` to verify direct and transitive circular dependency prevention.
- Implemented a private cycle detection algorithm in `TaskManagerService` to check for circular dependencies before updating a task.
- Integrated the cycle check into the `UpdateTask` method, throwing an `InvalidOperationException` if a cycle is detected.
- Verified that all unit tests now pass, confirming robust prevention of circular dependencies.

Our core service can now safely handle dependencies. The next step is to update the user-facing 'add' command to allow users to specify dependencies when they create a new task.

### **1. Target File**

Open the command handler for the 'add' command: `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/AddHandler.cs`.

### **2. Modify the `Execute` Method**

Inside the `Execute` method, after the last prompt for task details (the interactive date input) and just before the `TaskItem` object is created, you will add the new logic for dependencies.

### **3. Implementation Steps**

1.  **Prompt for Dependencies:**
    *   Add a `Console.WriteLine` to prompt the user to enter the IDs of the tasks that this new task depends on.
    *   The prompt must clearly state that the input should be a comma-separated list of numbers (e.g., "1, 5, 12") and that this step is optional (they can press Enter to skip).

2.  **Read and Process Input:**
    *   Read the user's input with `Console.ReadLine`.
    *   Check if the input string is null or empty. If it is, the logic is complete and the new task will have no dependencies.
    *   If the input is not empty, you must parse and validate it.

3.  **Parse and Validate the IDs:**
    *   Create a new empty `List<int>` to store the validated dependency IDs.
    *   Split the user's input string by the comma character to get an array of individual ID strings.
    *   Loop through each string in the array.
    *   Inside the loop, for each ID string:
        *   Trim any leading or trailing whitespace.
        *   Attempt to parse the string into an integer.
        *   If the parse is successful, use the `service.GetTaskById()` method to check if a task with that ID actually exists.
        *   If the task exists, add the parsed ID to your `List<int>` of validated dependencies.
        *   If parsing fails or if `GetTaskById()` returns null, print a warning message to the user that the specific invalid ID is being ignored.

4.  **Assign Dependencies:**
    *   Locate the section where the new `TaskItem` object is initialized.
    *   Assign your `List<int>` of validated dependency IDs to its `Dependencies` property.

### Copilot's Action

- Updated the 'add' command handler (`AddHandler.cs`) to prompt users for a comma-separated list of dependency IDs when creating a new task.
- Implemented parsing and validation logic to ensure only valid, existing task IDs are added as dependencies.
- Provided user feedback for invalid or non-existent IDs.
- Assigned the validated dependencies to the new task's `Dependencies` property before creation.

1.  In the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers` directory, create a new class file named `DependHandler.cs`.
2.  The class must implement the `ICommandHandler` interface.
3.  The main `Execute` method will act as a router. It should check the first argument provided in the `args` array.
    *   If the first argument is "add", it should call a private helper method for adding a dependency.
    *   If the first argument is "remove", it should call a private helper method for removing a dependency.
    *   If the argument is anything else or is missing, it should print usage instructions.

### **Step 2: Implement the "Add Dependency" Logic**

1.  Create a `private` method inside `DependHandler` that handles the `depend add` subcommand. Its signature should accept the `TaskManagerService` and the `args` array.
2.  The expected command format is `depend add <childId> <parentId>`. Your method must parse and validate this input.
3.  **Perform Validation:**
    *   Check if exactly three arguments are provided (`add`, `<childId>`, `<parentId>`).
    *   Verify that both IDs can be parsed into integers.
    *   Use `service.GetTaskById()` to retrieve both the child and parent task objects. Ensure neither is null.
    *   Check that the child and parent IDs are not the same.
    *   Check if the child task's `Dependencies` list already contains the parent's ID. If so, inform the user and do nothing.
4.  **Add the Dependency:**
    *   Add the parent's ID to the child task's `Dependencies` list.
    *   Use a `try-catch` block to call `service.UpdateTask(childTask)`.
    *   In the `try` block, on success, print a confirmation message.
    *   In the `catch` block for an `InvalidOperationException`, print a user-friendly error message stating that the action would create a circular dependency and was rejected.

### **Step 3: Implement the "Remove Dependency" Logic**

1.  Create another `private` method for the `depend remove` subcommand. The expected format is `depend remove <childId> <parentId>`.
2.  **Perform Validation:**
    *   Perform the same initial argument count and ID validation as the "add" logic.
    *   Retrieve both task objects.
    *   Check if the child task's `Dependencies` list actually contains the parent's ID. If it doesn't, inform the user and do nothing.
3.  **Remove the Dependency:**
    *   Remove the parent's ID from the child task's `Dependencies` list.
    *   Call `service.UpdateTask(childTask)` and print a confirmation message on success.

### **Step 4: Register the New Handler**

1.  Open `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Program.cs`.
2.  In the `commandHandlers` dictionary, add a new entry to register our new handler for the "depend" command.

### **Step 5: Update the Help Information**

1.  Open `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/HelpHandler.cs`.
2.  Add new lines to the help text to document the new commands: `depend add <childId> <parentId>` and `depend remove <childId> <parentId>`, along with a brief explanation of what they do.

### Copilot's Action

- Created `DependHandler.cs` in the `Handlers` directory, implementing logic for adding and removing dependencies between tasks.
- Registered the new handler in `Program.cs` for the `depend` command.
- Updated the help text in `HelpHandler.cs` to document the new `depend add` and `depend remove` commands.

## User Prompt

We have identified a bug where the `tasks.json` data file is being created in multiple locations depending on how the application is run. We need to fix this by ensuring the file is always saved to a single, consistent location in the root directory of the solution.

### **1. Target File**

Open the core service file: `PriorityTaskManager/Services/TaskManagerService.cs`.

### **2. Locate the File Path Logic**

Find the constructor of the `TaskManagerService` class. Inside it, you will find the line of code where the `_filePath` field is being assigned a simple relative path (e.g., `"tasks.json"`). We will replace this line.

### **3. Implement the New Path Logic**

Modify the constructor to calculate a stable path to the solution's root directory. The path should point to a `tasks.json` file located three levels above the application's base directory (which is typically the `bin/Debug/netX.X` folder).

1.  Delete the old line that assigns the file path.
2.  Add new logic that combines `AppContext.BaseDirectory` with relative navigation to construct the correct path. The result should be assigned to the `_filePath` field.
3.  The final logic should be equivalent to creating a path like `Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, \"../../../tasks.json\")`. This ensures that no matter where the executable runs, it always navigates up to the solution root to find the data file.

### **Important Final Steps (For You)**

After Copilot has made the code change, you will need to manually clean up the old files to avoid confusion:

1.  **Run the application once** to create the new, correctly placed `tasks.json` file in your main solution folder.
2.  **Manually delete** the old `tasks.json` file from inside the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project folder (likely in its `bin/Debug/...` subdirectory).
3.  **Manually delete** the old `tasks.json` file that was in the solution root, if it contains old data you don't need.
4.  If one of the old files has important tasks, copy its contents into the **newly generated** `tasks.json` file.

This will consolidate everything into one place and ensure consistent behavior from now on.

### Copilot's Action

- Updated the file path logic in `TaskManagerService.cs` to always save and load `tasks.json` from the solution root directory, three levels above the application's base directory.
- Ensured consistent data file location regardless of how the application is run.

# Log Entry 38

## User Prompt

Our application needs a way for users to see all the details of a specific task. We will create a new `view <Id>` command to provide this functionality.

### **Step 1: Create the `ViewHandler` Class**

1.  In the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers` directory, create a new class file named `ViewHandler.cs`.
2.  The class must implement the `ICommandHandler` interface.

### **Step 2: Implement the `Execute` Method**

Inside the `Execute` method, you will add the logic to find and display a task.

1.  **Validate Input:** Check the `args` array to ensure it contains exactly one argument. Attempt to parse this argument into an integer (the task ID). If the input is invalid, print a usage message (e.g., "Usage: view <Id>") and return.

2.  **Fetch the Task:** Use the `service.GetTaskById()` method with the parsed ID to retrieve the task.

3.  **Handle "Not Found":** If the returned task is null, print a "Task not found." message and return.

4.  **Display Task Details:** If the task is found, print its properties to the console in a clear, multi-line, human-readable format. At a minimum, display:
    *   ID
    *   Title
    *   Description
    *   Importance
    *   Due Date
    *   Is Completed status
    *   Estimated Duration
    *   Progress (as a percentage)
    *   Dependencies (as a comma-separated list of IDs, or "None")
    *   Urgency Score (for incomplete tasks)
    *   Latest Possible Start Date (for incomplete tasks)

### **Step 3: Register the New Handler**

1.  Open `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Program.cs`.
2.  In the `commandHandlers` dictionary, add a new entry to register the `ViewHandler` for the "view" command.

### **Step 4: Update the Help Information**

1.  Open `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/HelpHandler.cs`.
2.  Add a new line to the help text to document the `view <Id>` command and briefly explain what it does.

### Copilot's Action

- Created `ViewHandler.cs` in the `Handlers` directory, implementing logic to display all details of a specific task.
- Registered the new handler in `Program.cs` for the `view` command.
- Updated the help text in `HelpHandler.cs` to document the new `view <Id>` command.

# Log Entry 39

## User Prompt

We are going to enhance the `edit` command to make it more powerful. Currently, a targeted edit like `edit title 4` prompts the user for a new title. We want to allow the user to provide the new value directly in the command, for example: `edit 4 title My New Task Title`.

### **1. Target Files**

You will need to modify two files:
1.  `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/EditHandler.cs` (for the primary logic).
2.  `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/HelpHandler.cs` (to update the documentation).

### **2. Modify `EditHandler.cs`**

1.  **Update the `Execute` Method's Argument Parsing:**
    *   Locate the main `if/else if` block that parses the command arguments.
    *   The condition that checks for a targeted edit (likely `argsArr.Length == 2`) needs to be changed to handle more arguments.
    *   The logic should now parse the `attribute` from the first argument and the `Id` from the second argument.
    *   If there are more than two arguments, it should treat all subsequent arguments as the new value. You must join the arguments from index 2 to the end of the array (with spaces in between) to reconstruct the full `newValue` string.
    *   The private helper method for targeted updates should then be called with this `newValue`. If no value was provided, it should be called with `null`.

2.  **Modify the Private Helper Method for Targeted Updates:**
    *   This method (likely named `HandleTargetedUpdate` or similar) needs to be updated to accept an additional, optional string parameter for the new value (e.g., `string? directValue = null`).
    *   Inside this method, for each `case` in the `switch` statement (e.g., "title", "importance"):
        *   First, check if the `directValue` parameter is not null.
        *   If it is **not null**, use that value to update the task's property. For numeric properties like "importance" or "progress", you must attempt to parse the string and print an error message if parsing fails.
        *   If the `directValue` is **null**, keep the existing behavior of prompting the user for input with `Console.Write` and `Console.ReadLine`.

### **3. Update `HelpHandler.cs`**

1.  Open the `HelpHandler.cs` file.
2.  Find the line that documents the targeted `edit` command.
3.  Update the text to show the new, optional syntax. For example: `edit <Id> <attr> [new value] - Edit a specific attribute, optionally providing the new value directly.`

### Copilot's Action

- Enhanced the `edit` command in `EditHandler.cs` to support direct value input for targeted edits (e.g., `edit 4 title My New Task Title`).
- Updated the help text in `HelpHandler.cs` to document the new syntax for the enhanced edit command.

# Log Entry 40

## User Prompt

We are adding a new feature to allow users to apply commands to multiple tasks at once (e.g., 'delete 5,6,7'). To avoid code duplication, we will start by creating a central, reusable utility method to handle the parsing and validation of the task IDs.

### **1. Target File**

Open the utility class file: `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Utils/ConsoleInputHelper.cs`.

### **2. Create a New Static Method**

Your task is to create a new `public static` method inside this class.

*   **Name:** The method should be named `ParseAndValidateTaskIds`.
*   **Parameters:** It must accept two parameters: the `TaskManagerService` instance and the user's command-line arguments (`string[] args`).
*   **Return Type:** It must return a `List<int>` containing the valid, existing task IDs.

### **3. Implement the Method Logic**

Inside the `ParseAndValidateTaskIds` method, implement the following logic:

1.  Create an empty `List<int>` to hold the results.
2.  If the `args` array is empty, immediately return the empty list.
3.  The user's input might be a single string like "5,6,7". Join the `args` array into a single string, then split that string by the comma character to get an array of individual ID strings.
4.  Iterate through each potential ID string from the split array.
5.  Inside the loop, for each string:
    *   Trim any leading or trailing whitespace.
    *   Attempt to parse the string into an integer.
    *   If parsing is successful, use the `service.GetTaskById()` method to check if a task with that ID actually exists.
    *   If the task exists, add the ID to your results list.
    *   If parsing fails or if the task does not exist, print a user-friendly warning message to the console indicating that the specific ID is invalid and is being skipped.
6.  After the loop finishes, return the final list of valid IDs.

### Copilot's Action

Added a new static method `ParseAndValidateTaskIds` to the `ConsoleInputHelper` class. This method parses and validates task IDs from user input, ensuring only valid IDs are returned. It handles input parsing, validation, and user feedback for invalid or non-existent task IDs.

# Log Entry 41

## User Prompt

We have successfully created the `ParseAndValidateTaskIds` utility. Now, we will refactor the `delete`, `complete`, and `uncomplete` command handlers to use this new functionality, allowing them to operate on multiple tasks at once.

### **1. Target Files**

You will need to modify the `Execute` method in each of the following three files:
*   `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/DeleteHandler.cs`
*   `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/CompleteHandler.cs`
*   `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/UncompleteHandler.cs`

### **2. Refactoring Steps for Each Handler**

Apply the following logic to the `Execute` method within each of the three handlers:

1.  **Remove Old Logic:** Delete the existing code that parses a single task ID.

2.  **Call the Utility:** Make a single call to our new utility method: `ConsoleInputHelper.ParseAndValidateTaskIds(service, args)`. Store the returned `List<int>` in a local variable.

3.  **Check for Valid IDs:** Check if the returned list is empty. If it is, this means no valid tasks were specified. In this case, print a usage message (e.g., "Usage: delete <Id>,<Id2>...") and exit the method.

4.  **Loop and Execute:** Iterate through each `id` in the list of valid task IDs.
    *   Inside the loop, call the corresponding `TaskManagerService` method for that handler (e.g., `service.DeleteTask(id)`, `service.MarkTaskAsComplete(id)`, etc.).
    *   After each successful call, print a specific confirmation message to the user that includes the ID of the task that was just affected (e.g., "Task 5 deleted.", "Task 7 marked as complete.").

This new implementation will be cleaner and far more powerful than the original.

### Copilot's Action

- Refactored the `Execute` methods in `DeleteHandler`, `CompleteHandler`, and `UncompleteHandler` to use the `ConsoleInputHelper.ParseAndValidateTaskIds` utility method.
- Removed old logic for parsing single task IDs and replaced it with the new utility method.
- Updated each handler to process multiple task IDs, iterating through the list of valid IDs and performing the corresponding action for each.
- Ensured user-friendly messages are displayed for each operation, including warnings for invalid or non-existent task IDs.

We are beginning a major feature: multi-list management. This first step is to create all the necessary data structures for this feature. We will not be implementing any logic yet.

### **Step 1: Create the `SortOption` Enum**

1.  In the `PriorityTaskManager/Models` directory, create a new C# enum file named `SortOption.cs`.
2.  Define the public `SortOption` enum with the following four values:
    *   `Default`
    *   `Alphabetical`
    *   `DueDate`
    *   `Id`

### **Step 2: Create the `TaskList` Model**

1.  In the `PriorityTaskManager/Models` directory, create a new C# class file named `TaskList.cs`.
2.  Inside this class, add the following two public properties:
    *   A `string` property named `Name`.
    *   A `SortOption` property named `SortOption`.

### **Step 3: Update the `TaskItem` Model**

1.  Open the existing model file: `PriorityTaskManager/Models/TaskItem.cs`.
2.  Add a new `public string` property to this class named `ListName`.

### Copilot's Action

- Created the `SortOption` enum in `PriorityTaskManager/Models/SortOption.cs` with values `Default`, `Alphabetical`, `DueDate`, and `Id`.
- Created the `TaskList` model in `PriorityTaskManager/Models/TaskList.cs` with `Name` and `SortOption` properties.
- Updated the `TaskItem` model in `PriorityTaskManager/Models/TaskItem.cs` to include a new `ListName` property for associating tasks with specific lists.

# Log Entry 44

## User Prompt

Thanks! We have created our data models for lists. Now, we will upgrade the `TaskManagerService` to handle the persistence of these lists.

### **1. Target File**

Open the core service file: `PriorityTaskManager/Services/TaskManagerService.cs`.

### **2. Add New Fields and Update Constructor**

1.  Add two new private fields to the top of the class:
    *   One `string` field to store the file path for `lists.json`. Name it `_listFilePath`.
    *   One `List<TaskList>` field to store the lists in memory. Name it `_lists`.
2.  Update the `TaskManagerService` constructor:
    *   Initialize the new `_listFilePath` field using the same path-building logic as the existing `_filePath`, but targeting `lists.json`.
    *   Initialize the new `_lists` field to an empty list.
    *   Add a call to a new method we are about to create: `LoadLists()`.

### **3. Implement `LoadLists` and `SaveLists`**

1.  **Create a `private void LoadLists()` method.**
    *   This method should read and deserialize the JSON from the `_listFilePath`.
    *   **Crucially:** It must check if the file exists. If the file does **not** exist, it should create a default list, add it to the `_lists` field, and then immediately call the `SaveLists()` method. The default list should be a new `TaskList` object with its `Name` set to "General" and its `SortOption` set to `SortOption.Default`.
2.  **Create a `private void SaveLists()` method.**
    *   This method should serialize the in-memory `_lists` field to JSON and write it to the `_listFilePath`.

### **4. Create New Public Methods for List Management**

Add the following three new `public` methods to the class. These will be the primary ways we interact with lists.

1.  `public void AddList(TaskList list)`:
    *   Before adding, check if a list with the same `Name` already exists in the `_lists` field (case-insensitive). If it does, throw an `InvalidOperationException` with a clear error message.
    *   If the name is unique, add the new list to the `_lists` field and call `SaveLists()`.
2.  `public TaskList? GetListByName(string listName)`:
    *   Searches the `_lists` field for a list whose `Name` matches the provided `listName` (case-insensitive).
    *   Returns the found `TaskList` object or `null` if no match is found.
3.  `public IEnumerable<TaskList> GetAllLists()`:
    *   Returns the entire `_lists` field.

### Copilot's Action

- Added two new private fields to `TaskManagerService`: `_listFilePath` for the `lists.json` file path and `_lists` for in-memory storage of task lists.
- Updated the constructor to initialize these fields and call the new `LoadLists` method.
- Implemented the `LoadLists` method to load lists from `lists.json` or create a default "General" list if the file does not exist.
- Implemented the `SaveLists` method to persist the `_lists` field to `lists.json`.
- Added three new public methods for list management:
  - `AddList` to add a new list, ensuring unique names.
  - `GetListByName` to retrieve a list by its name.
  - `GetAllLists` to retrieve all lists.

  # Log Entry 45

## User Prompt

We have successfully implemented persistence for our lists. The final backend step is to modify our existing task management methods to recognize and interact with these lists. This will connect our two data models.

### **1. Target File**

Open the core service file: `PriorityTaskManager/Services/TaskManagerService.cs`.

### **2. Modify the `GetAllTasks` Method**

1.  Locate the existing `public IEnumerable<TaskItem> GetAllTasks()` method.
2.  Change its signature to `public IEnumerable<TaskItem> GetAllTasks(string listName)`.
3.  Modify the implementation. Instead of returning the entire `_tasks` list, it must now use a LINQ `Where` clause to filter and return only the tasks where the `ListName` property matches the `listName` parameter (case-insensitive).

### **3. Modify the `AddTask` Method**

1.  Locate the `public void AddTask(TaskItem task)` method.
2.  Before the new task is added to the `_tasks` list, you must set its `ListName` property.
3.  For now, to ensure data integrity, hardcode this value. Add the following line: `task.ListName = "General";`. (We will make this dynamic in a later step when we introduce the concept of an "active list" in the CLI).

### **4. Create the `DeleteList` Method**

Create a new `public` method to handle deleting a list and all its associated tasks.

1.  **Name:** `public void DeleteList(string listName)`
2.  **Implementation:**
    *   Find the list to delete from the `_lists` field based on the `listName` (case-insensitive). If the list doesn't exist, simply return.
    *   Remove the found list from the `_lists` collection.
    *   Use the `_tasks.RemoveAll()` method with a predicate to find and delete every task from the master task list where the `ListName` property matches the `listName` you are deleting.
    *   Call `SaveLists()` to persist the change to the lists.
    *   Call `SaveTasks()` to persist the changes to the tasks, ensuring the orphaned tasks are removed from the file.

### Copilot's Action

- Modified the `GetAllTasks` method to filter tasks by the `ListName` property, returning only tasks associated with the specified list.
- Updated the `AddTask` method to assign new tasks to the default "General" list by setting the `ListName` property.
- Implemented the `DeleteList` method to remove a list and all tasks associated with it. This includes:
  - Removing the list from the `_lists` collection.
  - Deleting tasks from the `_tasks` list where the `ListName` matches the deleted list.
  - Persisting changes to both lists and tasks by calling `SaveLists` and `SaveTasks`.

# Log Entry 46

## User Prompt

The backend now supports lists, but the user has no way to interact with them. In this step, we will introduce the concept of an "active list" and transform the `ListHandler` into a subcommand router for managing lists.

### **Step 1: Introduce the "Active List" State**

1.  Open `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Program.cs`.
2.  At the top of the `Program` class, add a new `public static string` property to hold the application's state.
3.  Name it `ActiveListName` and initialize its value to "General". This will be the default list.

### **Step 2: Refactor `ListHandler` into a Subcommand Router**

Open `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/ListHandler.cs`. We will completely replace its current logic.

1.  **The `Execute` Method:** This method will now act as a router.
    *   Delete the existing code inside `Execute`.
    *   The new logic should check the first element of the `args` array.
    *   If `args` is empty or the first argument is "view", it should call a new private method named `HandleViewTasksInActiveList()`.
    *   If the first argument is "all", it should call `HandleViewAllLists()`.
    *   If it is "create", call `HandleCreateList()`.
    *   If it is "switch", call `HandleSwitchList()`.
    *   If it is "delete", call `HandleDeleteList()`.
    *   For any other input, print a new usage message that explains these subcommands.

2.  **Create Placeholder for Task Viewing:**
    *   Create the `private void HandleViewTasksInActiveList()` method. For now, just add a single line inside it: `Console.WriteLine("Task viewing logic will be implemented in the next step.");` We will build this out in the next prompt.

### **Step 3: Implement the List Management Subcommands**

Create the following new private methods inside `ListHandler.cs`.

1.  **`HandleViewAllLists()`:**
    *   Call `service.GetAllLists()` to get all the lists.
    *   Loop through the lists and print each one's `Name`.
    *   For the list whose name matches `Program.ActiveListName`, add a visual indicator next to its name (e.g., `* General (Active)`).

2.  **`HandleCreateList()`:**
    *   This subcommand expects a name (e.g., `list create My New List`). Join the arguments after "create" to form the list name.
    *   Create a new `TaskList` object with the provided name.
    *   Use a `try-catch` block. In the `try` block, call `service.AddList()` and print a success message. In the `catch` block for `InvalidOperationException`, print a user-friendly error that the list name already exists.

3.  **`HandleSwitchList()`:**
    *   This subcommand expects a list name (e.g., `list switch Work`).
    *   Use `service.GetListByName()` to check if the list exists.
    *   If it exists, update `Program.ActiveListName` to the new name and print a confirmation message.
    *   If it does not exist, print an error message.

4.  **`HandleDeleteList()`:**
    *   This subcommand expects a list name (e.g., `list delete Shopping`).
    *   Check if the user is trying to delete the "General" list. If so, print an error and refuse the action; the "General" list cannot be deleted.
    *   Provide a confirmation prompt: "Are you sure you want to delete this list and all its tasks? (y/n)".
    *   If the user confirms, check if the list they are deleting is the currently active list. If it is, first switch the active list back to "General" by setting `Program.ActiveListName = "General";`.
    *   Finally, call `service.DeleteList()` with the provided name and print a success message.

### Copilot's Action

1. Introduced the `ActiveListName` static property in `Program.cs` to manage the application's active list state.
2. Refactored `ListHandler` to act as a subcommand router for managing lists.
3. Added methods for handling subcommands: `HandleViewTasksInActiveList`, `HandleViewAllLists`, `HandleCreateList`, `HandleSwitchList`, and `HandleDeleteList`.

# Log Entry 47

## User Prompt

We have successfully refactored the `ListHandler` into a subcommand hub. Now we need to implement the core logic for viewing and sorting tasks, and give the user control over the sort order.

### **Step 1: Create an `UpdateList` Method in the Service**

First, we need a way to save changes to a list (like changing its sort order).

1.  Open `PriorityTaskManager/Services/TaskManagerService.cs`.
2.  Create a new `public void UpdateList(TaskList updatedList)` method.
3.  Inside this method, find the existing list in the `_lists` collection by matching the `Name`.
4.  If found, update its properties (specifically the `SortOption`).
5.  Call `SaveLists()` to persist the change.

### **Step 2: Implement the `HandleViewTasksInActiveList` Method**

Open `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/ListHandler.cs`. It's time to replace the placeholder logic in the task viewing method.

1.  Locate the `private void HandleViewTasksInActiveList()` method. Delete the placeholder message inside it.
2.  **Fetch Data:**
    *   Get the active list's name from `Program.ActiveListName`.
    *   Use `service.GetListByName()` to get the full `TaskList` object. If it's null, print an error and return.
    *   Use `service.GetAllTasks()` with the active list name to get all associated tasks.
3.  **Sort Tasks:**
    *   Create a `switch` statement that checks the `SortOption` property of the `TaskList` object you just fetched.
    *   **Case `SortOption.Default`:** First, call `service.CalculateUrgencyForAllTasks()`. Then, sort the tasks by `UrgencyScore` in descending order.
    *   **Case `SortOption.Alphabetical`:** Sort the tasks by their `Title` property in alphabetical order.
    *   **Case `SortOption.DueDate`:** Sort the tasks by their `DueDate` property in ascending order.
    *   **Case `SortOption.Id`:** Sort the tasks by their `Id` property in ascending order.
4.  **Display Tasks:**
    *   After sorting, check if the list of tasks is empty. If so, print a message like "No tasks found in this list."
    *   If there are tasks, loop through the sorted collection and display them using the same format as the old `list` command (e.g., showing the checkbox, ID, Title, and Urgency/LPSD when sorted by Default).

### **Step 3: Implement the `list sort` Subcommand**

Now, create the logic for changing a list's sort order.

1.  **Create a `private void HandleSetSortOption()` method** inside `ListHandler.cs`. This method will handle the `list sort <option>` command.
2.  **Parse Input:** The method should expect the sort option as the next argument (e.g., `args[1]`). Use `Enum.TryParse<SortOption>(...)` (with `ignoreCase = true`) to parse the user's input into a valid `SortOption`.
3.  **Handle Invalid Input:** If parsing fails, print an error message to the user that lists the valid options (`Default`, `Alphabetical`, `DueDate`, `Id`).
4.  **Update the List:** If parsing is successful, get the active `TaskList` object using `service.GetListByName(Program.ActiveListName)`. Update its `SortOption` property to the new value, and then call our new `service.UpdateList()` method to save the change. Print a success message.

### **Step 4: Update the Command Router and Help Text**

1.  In the main `Execute` method of `ListHandler`, add a new case to the router. If the first argument is "sort", it should call your new `HandleSetSortOption()` method.
2.  Update the usage message that your router prints for invalid commands to include the new `list sort <option>` command.

### Copilot's Action

1. Added the `UpdateList` method in `TaskManagerService` to update a `TaskList`'s properties and persist changes.
2. Implemented the `HandleViewTasksInActiveList` method in `ListHandler` to fetch, sort, and display tasks based on the active list's `SortOption`.
3. Added the `HandleSetSortOption` method in `ListHandler` to allow users to change the sort order of the active list.
4. Updated the `Execute` method in `ListHandler` to include the `list sort <option>` subcommand.

Our `list` command is now fully list-aware, but our other commands are not. In this step, we will connect the `add` command to the "active list" system and improve the `view` command to provide more context.

### **Step 1: Decouple the `TaskManagerService`**

First, we need to make a small but important change to the service layer. The service should not be responsible for deciding which list a task belongs to.

1.  Open `PriorityTaskManager/Services/TaskManagerService.cs`.
2.  Locate the `AddTask` method.
3.  Find and **delete** the line that hardcodes the list name (e.g., `task.ListName = "General";`). The service will now trust that the `TaskItem` it receives already has the correct `ListName` set by the caller.

### **Step 2: Update the `AddHandler`**

This is the core of the change. We will make the `add` command aware of the active list.

1.  Open `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/AddHandler.cs`.
2.  Locate the `Execute` method. Find the section where the new `TaskItem` object is initialized.
3.  Add a new line to this object initializer to set the `ListName` property.
4.  The value for this property must come from our static state variable: `Program.ActiveListName`.

### **Step 3: Update the `ViewHandler`**

When a user views a task, they should know which list it belongs to.

1.  Open `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/ViewHandler.cs`.
2.  Locate the `Execute` method. Find the section where you are printing the task's details.
3.  Add a new line to the output that displays the value of the task's `ListName` property. Label it clearly (e.g., "List: Home").

### Copilot's Action

1. Removed the hardcoded assignment of the `ListName` property in the `AddTask` method of `TaskManagerService`.
2. Updated the `AddHandler` to set the `ListName` property of the new task to the active list (`Program.ActiveListName`).
3. Updated the `ViewHandler` to display the `ListName` of the task being viewed.

## User Prompt

We have successfully implemented the entire multi-list feature. The final step is to update the main help text to document all the new `list` subcommands that are now available to the user.

### **1. Target File**

Open the command handler file for the 'help' command: `PriorityTaskManager.CLI/Handlers/HelpHandler.cs`.

### **2. Modify the `Execute` Method**

You will be replacing the old, simple description of the `list` command with a more detailed, multi-line explanation of its new capabilities.

1.  **Remove Old `list` Command:** Find the single `Console.WriteLine` that describes the old `list` command and delete it.

2.  **Add New `list` Subcommands:** In its place, add a new block of `Console.WriteLine` statements to document the new `list` command hub. Use formatting to make it clear these are subcommands.

Your new documentation should include entries for:
*   `list` or `list view`: Explain that this displays tasks in the current active list.
*   `list all`: Explain that this shows all available lists.
*   `list create <ListName>`: Explain that this creates a new task list.
*   `list switch <ListName>`: Explain that this sets the active task list.
*   `list sort <option>`: Explain that this changes the sort order for the active list and list the valid options (`Default`, `Alphabetical`, `DueDate`, `Id`).
*   `list delete <ListName>`: Explain that this deletes a list and all of its tasks.

This is the final step. Once complete, the multi-list feature is fully implemented and documented.

### Copilot's Action

1. Updated the `Execute` method in `HelpHandler` to replace the old `list` command description with detailed documentation for the new `list` subcommands.
2. Added entries for `list view`, `list all`, `list create`, `list switch`, `list sort`, and `list delete` to the help text.
