## User Prompt
Act as my lead AI developer for our new project: a Priority Task Manager. Your primary goal is to build a highly scalable and testable application.
Core Architectural Principles:
Scalability: We will enforce a strict separation of concerns. All core business logic must be independent of the user interface (UI). We will start with a C# CLI, but the architecture must support a future transition to a Flutter GUI.
Test-Driven Development: This is our most important rule. For every piece of functionality you create, you must also create a corresponding set of unit tests. We will use a dedicated test project for this. Your workflow should always be:
Implement a new feature or logic in the core project.
Immediately create or update tests in the test project to validate that feature.
Logging:
Maintain a numbered log in copilot_log.md. For each of my prompts that changes the code, create a new entry with my verbatim prompt and a summary of your actions, including both the feature code and the test code you generated.
Project Summary (For Your Reference):
[Paste the full project summary document here]
Let's Begin: Your First Task
Your first task is to set up the project structure and create our first testable feature.
Create a Test Project: Add a new xUnit Test Project to our solution. Name it PriorityTaskManager.Tests.
Reference Core Logic: Ensure the PriorityTaskManager.Tests project has a project reference to the main Priority-Task-Manager project so it can test its code.
Create the Data Model: In the main project, create a new folder named Models. Inside it, define a C# class named TaskItem.cs with properties for the Core Attributes from the project summary (Importance, Due Date, etc.), using appropriate data types.
Create a Service: In the main project, create a new folder named Services. Inside it, define a class named TaskManagerService.cs. This service should manage a private list of TaskItem objects and have a public method void AddTask(TaskItem task).
Write the First Test: In the PriorityTaskManager.Tests project, create a test class TaskManagerServiceTests.cs. Add a test method named AddTask_ShouldIncreaseTaskCount. This test should:
Create an instance of TaskManagerService.
Add a new TaskItem.
Assert that the count of tasks within the service is now 1.
After completing all steps, create copilot_log.md and log this as the third entry.

### Copilot's Action
Set up the solution and project structure for Priority Task Manager:
- Created a class library for core logic and an xUnit test project.
- Added project references and solution entries.
- Implemented the TaskItem data model and TaskManagerService in the main project.
- Created the first unit test (AddTask_ShouldIncreaseTaskCount) in the test project to validate adding tasks.

Thank you for the setup. Our next goal is to implement the full set of CRUD operations in our `TaskManagerService`. We will follow our test-driven development rule.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Enhance the Model:**
	*   In `TaskItem.cs`, add a unique identifier property: `public int Id { get; set; }`. This is crucial for finding, updating, and deleting specific tasks.

2.  **Expand the Service:**
	*   In `TaskManagerService.cs`, add the following public methods:
		*   `IEnumerable<TaskItem> GetAllTasks()`: Returns a copy of the entire task list.
		*   `TaskItem GetTaskById(int id)`: Finds and returns a task by its `Id`. Should return `null` if not found.
		*   `bool UpdateTask(TaskItem updatedTask)`: Finds an existing task by its `Id` and updates its properties. Should return `true` on success and `false` if the task was not found.
		*   `bool DeleteTask(int id)`: Removes a task from the list by its `Id`. Should return `true` on success and `false` if the task was not found.
	*   You will also need to add a private field like `private int _nextId = 1;` and logic inside your `AddTask` method to assign and increment the `Id` for each new task.

3.  **Write Corresponding Tests:**
	*   In `TaskManagerServiceTests.cs`, add new test methods to verify the functionality of each method you just created:
		*   `GetTaskById_ShouldReturnCorrectTask_WhenTaskExists`
		*   `GetTaskById_ShouldReturnNull_WhenTaskDoesNotExist`
		*   `UpdateTask_ShouldChangeTaskProperties_WhenTaskExists`
		*   `DeleteTask_ShouldRemoveTaskFromList_WhenTaskExists`

4.  **Clean Up:**
	*   Deleted unused boilerplate files: `PriorityTaskManager/Class1.cs` and `PriorityTaskManager.Tests/UnitTest1.cs`.

### Copilot's Action
Enhanced the TaskItem model with a unique Id property. Implemented full CRUD operations in TaskManagerService, including GetAllTasks, GetTaskById, UpdateTask, and DeleteTask, with unique Id assignment. Added comprehensive unit tests for all CRUD methods in TaskManagerServiceTests. Removed unused boilerplate files from both projects. All tests passed successfully.

With the core service logic in place, our next task is to create an interactive user interface in the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project. This will allow us to manually test the CRUD operations we've implemented.

**Your Task:**

Refactor the `Program.cs` file in the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project to create a menu-driven application.

1.  **Instantiate the Service:**
	*   At the beginning of the `Main` method, create a single instance of `TaskManagerService`. This instance will be passed to the methods that need it.

2.  **Create the Main Loop:**
	*   Implement a `while` loop that runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.
	*   Inside the loop, first display the menu of options, then wait for the user's input.

3.  **Implement Menu Logic:**
	*   Use a `switch` statement to handle the user's menu choice.
	*   The menu should present the following options:
		1.  Add a New Task
		2.  View All Tasks
		3.  Update an Existing Task
		4.  Delete a Task
		5.  Exit

4.  **Create Helper Methods:**
	*   To keep the `Main` method clean, create separate `private static` methods for each menu option's functionality (e.g., `HandleAddTask`, `HandleViewAllTasks`, etc.).

5.  **Implement Functionality for Each Option:**
	*   **Add Task:** Prompt the user for a `Title`, `Description`, and `Importance`. Create a new `TaskItem` object, pass it to the service's `AddTask` method, and print a success message.
	*   **View All Tasks:** Call the service's `GetAllTasks` method. If there are no tasks, print a message saying so. Otherwise, loop through the tasks and print the `Id`, `Title`, `Description`, and `IsCompleted` status for each one in a readable format.
	*   **Update Task:** Prompt the user for the `Id` of the task to update. Ask for the new `Title` and `Description`. Call the `UpdateTask` method and inform the user if the update was successful or if the task was not found.
	*   **Delete Task:** Prompt the user for the `Id` of the task to delete. Call the service's `DeleteTask` method and inform the user if the deletion was successful or if the task was not found.
	*   **Exit:** Cause the main loop to terminate, printing a "Goodbye!" message.

### Copilot's Action
Refactored Program.cs in PriorityTaskManager.CLI to implement a menu-driven interactive CLI for manual CRUD testing. Added helper methods for each menu option and ensured clean separation of logic. The CLI now allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks interactively.

Excellent progress. Our next task is to enhance the task model and add a key piece of functionality: marking tasks as complete. We will also refactor the `Importance` scale to be more granular. As always, we will follow our test-driven development workflow.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Refactor the Task Model (`TaskItem.cs`):**
	*   Delete the `ImportanceLevel` enum entirely.
	*   Change the `Importance` property in the `TaskItem` class from type `ImportanceLevel` to `int`.

2.  **Add New Service Logic (`TaskManagerService.cs`):**
	*   Create a new public method: `bool MarkTaskAsComplete(int id)`.
	*   This method should find the task by its `Id` and set its `IsCompleted` property to `true`. It should return `true` on success and `false` if the task is not found.

3.  **Update and Add Tests (`TaskManagerServiceTests.cs`):**
	*   Update all existing test methods that use `ImportanceLevel` to use integer values for `Importance`.
	*   Add a new test method: `MarkTaskAsComplete_ShouldSetIsCompletedToTrue_WhenTaskExists`.

4.  **Update the CLI (`Program.cs`):**
	*   Modify "Add Task" to prompt for importance (1-10) and validate input.
	*   Modify "Update Task" to allow updating importance (1-10).
	*   Add "Complete Task" functionality with a new menu option and handler.

### Copilot's Action
Refactored the TaskItem model to use an int for Importance and removed the enum. Added MarkTaskAsComplete to the service. Updated all tests for the new model and added a test for marking tasks complete. Enhanced the CLI to support granular importance, updating importance, and marking tasks as complete. All tests pass successfully.

Implement dynamic urgency calculation based on dependencies and deadlines. The urgency score for each task should reflect how soon it must be started, considering all downstream dependencies and their deadlines. The calculation must ensure that the first task in a dependency chain is the most urgent, and urgency should decrease as you move down the chain. Integrate this logic into the CLI and ensure strict TDD: every feature must have corresponding unit tests that validate the dependency-aware urgency calculation.

### Copilot's Action
- Refactored the data model (`TaskItem.cs`) to support dependency chains and urgency attributes.
- Implemented recursive urgency calculation in `TaskManagerService.cs`, ensuring the first task in a dependency chain is most urgent.
- Updated the CLI to display urgency and LPSD for all tasks, sorted by urgency.
- Added and validated unit tests in `TaskManagerServiceTests.cs` to confirm correct urgency ordering for dependency chains.
- Debugged and iterated on the calculation logic until all tests passed, confirming robust dependency-aware prioritization.

We are performing a major overhaul of the Command-Line Interface to make it significantly faster, more intuitive, and more user-friendly. This will involve replacing the numeric menu with a modern command-and-argument system and implementing an advanced, interactive editor for date inputs.

**Your Task:**

**Part 1: Implement a New Command Parser**
*   In `Program.cs`, remove the main `while` loop that displays a numbered menu.
*   Replace it with a new loop that reads a full line of user input (e.g., "add My new task").
*   Split the input into a command (the first word) and an array of arguments (the rest).
*   Use a `switch` statement on the command string to call the appropriate handler methods.

**Part 2: Overhaul the "Add Task" Workflow**
*   The new command will be: `add <Title>`. The title is the only required part of the initial command.
*   Refactor the `HandleAddTask` method to accept the title from the command arguments.
*   For all other attributes **except the Due Date**, prompt the user individually but allow them to **press Enter (providing an empty input) to accept a default value.**
    *   **Defaults:** Description (`string.Empty`), Importance (`5`), Estimated Duration (`TimeSpan.FromHours(1)`), Progress (`0.0`), Dependencies (empty list).
*   **For the Due Date prompt, you will implement a special interactive editor:**
    *   Create a new `private static` helper method: `DateTime HandleInteractiveDateInput(DateTime initialDate)`.
