# Log Entry 1
## User Prompt
Act as my AI coding agent. Your primary role is to modify the codebase based on my requests.
Also, maintain a numbered log of our interactions in copilot_log.md.
Logging rules:
Create a new numbered entry for each prompt that results in a code change. Start with # Log Entry 1 and increment the number for each new entry.
Record my exact prompt under a ## User Prompt heading.
Below my prompt, add a concise summary of your changes under a ### Copilot's Action heading.
Append each new, numbered entry to the copilot_log.md file. Please start now. Thank you!

### Copilot's Action
Initialized copilot_log.md and recorded the first user prompt with instructions for logging future code changes.

# Log Entry 2
## User Prompt
Great. Now please generate a project for a basic command-line interface (CLI) application in C# using this folder.

### Copilot's Action
Generated a new C# CLI project structure in the workspace folder, ready for development and extension.
# Log Entry 3
## User Prompt
Act as my lead AI developer for our new project: a Priority Task Manager. Your primary goal is to build a highly scalable and testable application.
Core Architectural Principles:
Scalability: We will enforce a strict separation of concerns. All core business logic must be independent of the user interface (UI). We will start with a C# CLI, but the architecture must support a future transition to a Flutter GUI.
Test-Driven Development: This is our most important rule. For every piece of functionality you create, you must also create a corresponding set of unit tests. We will use a dedicated test project for this. Your workflow should always be:
Implement a new feature or logic in the core project.
Immediately create or update tests in the test project to validate that feature.
Logging:
Maintain a numbered log in copilot_log.md. For each of my prompts that changes the code, create a new entry with my verbatim prompt and a summary of your actions, including both the feature code and the test code you generated.
Project Summary (For Your Reference):
[Paste the full project summary document here]
Let's Begin: Your First Task
Your first task is to set up the project structure and create our first testable feature.
Create a Test Project: Add a new xUnit Test Project to our solution. Name it PriorityTaskManager.Tests.
Reference Core Logic: Ensure the PriorityTaskManager.Tests project has a project reference to the main Priority-Task-Manager project so it can test its code.
Create the Data Model: In the main project, create a new folder named Models. Inside it, define a C# class named TaskItem.cs with properties for the Core Attributes from the project summary (Importance, Due Date, etc.), using appropriate data types.
Create a Service: In the main project, create a new folder named Services. Inside it, define a class named TaskManagerService.cs. This service should manage a private list of TaskItem objects and have a public method void AddTask(TaskItem task).
Write the First Test: In the PriorityTaskManager.Tests project, create a test class TaskManagerServiceTests.cs. Add a test method named AddTask_ShouldIncreaseTaskCount. This test should:
Create an instance of TaskManagerService.
Add a new TaskItem.
Assert that the count of tasks within the service is now 1.
After completing all steps, create copilot_log.md and log this as the third entry.

### Copilot's Action
Set up the solution and project structure for Priority Task Manager:
- Created a class library for core logic and an xUnit test project.
- Added project references and solution entries.
- Implemented the TaskItem data model and TaskManagerService in the main project.
- Created the first unit test (AddTask_ShouldIncreaseTaskCount) in the test project to validate adding tasks.

# Log Entry 4
## User Prompt
Please add a CLI console project to your solution and set up a basic entry point?

### Copilot's Action
Created a new CLI console application project (PriorityTaskManager.CLI), added it to the solution, and referenced the core logic project. Updated Program.cs to demonstrate basic usage of TaskManagerService and TaskItem. Ran the CLI app to verify functionality.
