# Log Entry 1
## User Prompt
Act as my AI coding agent. Your primary role is to modify the codebase based on my requests.
Also, maintain a numbered log of our interactions in copilot_log.md.
Logging rules:
Create a new numbered entry for each prompt that results in a code change. Start with # Log Entry 1 and increment the number for each new entry.
Record my exact prompt under a ## User Prompt heading.
Below my prompt, add a concise summary of your changes under a ### Copilot's Action heading.
Append each new, numbered entry to the copilot_log.md file. Please start now. Thank you!

### Copilot's Action
Initialized copilot_log.md and recorded the first user prompt with instructions for logging future code changes.

# Log Entry 2
## User Prompt
Great. Now please generate a project for a basic command-line interface (CLI) application in C# using this folder.

### Copilot's Action
Generated a new C# CLI project structure in the workspace folder, ready for development and extension.
# Log Entry 3
## User Prompt
Act as my lead AI developer for our new project: a Priority Task Manager. Your primary goal is to build a highly scalable and testable application.
Core Architectural Principles:
Scalability: We will enforce a strict separation of concerns. All core business logic must be independent of the user interface (UI). We will start with a C# CLI, but the architecture must support a future transition to a Flutter GUI.
Test-Driven Development: This is our most important rule. For every piece of functionality you create, you must also create a corresponding set of unit tests. We will use a dedicated test project for this. Your workflow should always be:
Implement a new feature or logic in the core project.
Immediately create or update tests in the test project to validate that feature.
Logging:
Maintain a numbered log in copilot_log.md. For each of my prompts that changes the code, create a new entry with my verbatim prompt and a summary of your actions, including both the feature code and the test code you generated.
Project Summary (For Your Reference):
[Paste the full project summary document here]
Let's Begin: Your First Task
Your first task is to set up the project structure and create our first testable feature.
Create a Test Project: Add a new xUnit Test Project to our solution. Name it PriorityTaskManager.Tests.
Reference Core Logic: Ensure the PriorityTaskManager.Tests project has a project reference to the main Priority-Task-Manager project so it can test its code.
Create the Data Model: In the main project, create a new folder named Models. Inside it, define a C# class named TaskItem.cs with properties for the Core Attributes from the project summary (Importance, Due Date, etc.), using appropriate data types.
Create a Service: In the main project, create a new folder named Services. Inside it, define a class named TaskManagerService.cs. This service should manage a private list of TaskItem objects and have a public method void AddTask(TaskItem task).
Write the First Test: In the PriorityTaskManager.Tests project, create a test class TaskManagerServiceTests.cs. Add a test method named AddTask_ShouldIncreaseTaskCount. This test should:
Create an instance of TaskManagerService.
Add a new TaskItem.
Assert that the count of tasks within the service is now 1.
After completing all steps, create copilot_log.md and log this as the third entry.

### Copilot's Action
Set up the solution and project structure for Priority Task Manager:
- Created a class library for core logic and an xUnit test project.
- Added project references and solution entries.
- Implemented the TaskItem data model and TaskManagerService in the main project.
- Created the first unit test (AddTask_ShouldIncreaseTaskCount) in the test project to validate adding tasks.

# Log Entry 4
## User Prompt
Please add a CLI console project to your solution and set up a basic entry point.

### Copilot's Action
Created a new CLI console application project (PriorityTaskManager.CLI), added it to the solution, and referenced the core logic project. Updated Program.cs to demonstrate basic usage of TaskManagerService and TaskItem. Ran the CLI app to verify functionality.

## User Prompt
Thank you for the setup. Our next goal is to implement the full set of CRUD operations in our `TaskManagerService`. We will follow our test-driven development rule.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Enhance the Model:**
	*   In `TaskItem.cs`, add a unique identifier property: `public int Id { get; set; }`. This is crucial for finding, updating, and deleting specific tasks.

2.  **Expand the Service:**
	*   In `TaskManagerService.cs`, add the following public methods:
		*   `IEnumerable<TaskItem> GetAllTasks()`: Returns a copy of the entire task list.
		*   `TaskItem GetTaskById(int id)`: Finds and returns a task by its `Id`. Should return `null` if not found.
		*   `bool UpdateTask(TaskItem updatedTask)`: Finds an existing task by its `Id` and updates its properties. Should return `true` on success and `false` if the task was not found.
		*   `bool DeleteTask(int id)`: Removes a task from the list by its `Id`. Should return `true` on success and `false` if the task was not found.
	*   You will also need to add a private field like `private int _nextId = 1;` and logic inside your `AddTask` method to assign and increment the `Id` for each new task.

3.  **Write Corresponding Tests:**
	*   In `TaskManagerServiceTests.cs`, add new test methods to verify the functionality of each method you just created:
		*   `GetTaskById_ShouldReturnCorrectTask_WhenTaskExists`
		*   `GetTaskById_ShouldReturnNull_WhenTaskDoesNotExist`
		*   `UpdateTask_ShouldChangeTaskProperties_WhenTaskExists`
		*   `DeleteTask_ShouldRemoveTaskFromList_WhenTaskExists`

4.  **Clean Up:**
	*   Deleted unused boilerplate files: `PriorityTaskManager/Class1.cs` and `PriorityTaskManager.Tests/UnitTest1.cs`.

### Copilot's Action
Enhanced the TaskItem model with a unique Id property. Implemented full CRUD operations in TaskManagerService, including GetAllTasks, GetTaskById, UpdateTask, and DeleteTask, with unique Id assignment. Added comprehensive unit tests for all CRUD methods in TaskManagerServiceTests. Removed unused boilerplate files from both projects. All tests passed successfully.

With the core service logic in place, our next task is to create an interactive user interface in the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project. This will allow us to manually test the CRUD operations we've implemented.

**Your Task:**

Refactor the `Program.cs` file in the `PriorityTaskManager.CLI` project to create a menu-driven application.

1.  **Instantiate the Service:**
	*   At the beginning of the `Main` method, create a single instance of `TaskManagerService`. This instance will be passed to the methods that need it.

2.  **Create the Main Loop:**
	*   Implement a `while` loop that runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.
	*   Inside the loop, first display the menu of options, then wait for the user's input.

3.  **Implement Menu Logic:**
	*   Use a `switch` statement to handle the user's menu choice.
	*   The menu should present the following options:
		1.  Add a New Task
		2.  View All Tasks
		3.  Update an Existing Task
		4.  Delete a Task
		5.  Exit

4.  **Create Helper Methods:**
	*   To keep the `Main` method clean, create separate `private static` methods for each menu option's functionality (e.g., `HandleAddTask`, `HandleViewAllTasks`, etc.).

5.  **Implement Functionality for Each Option:**
	*   **Add Task:** Prompt the user for a `Title`, `Description`, and `Importance`. Create a new `TaskItem` object, pass it to the service's `AddTask` method, and print a success message.
	*   **View All Tasks:** Call the service's `GetAllTasks` method. If there are no tasks, print a message saying so. Otherwise, loop through the tasks and print the `Id`, `Title`, `Description`, and `IsCompleted` status for each one in a readable format.
	*   **Update Task:** Prompt the user for the `Id` of the task to update. Ask for the new `Title` and `Description`. Call the `UpdateTask` method and inform the user if the update was successful or if the task was not found.
	*   **Delete Task:** Prompt the user for the `Id` of the task to delete. Call the service's `DeleteTask` method and inform the user if the deletion was successful or if the task was not found.
	*   **Exit:** Cause the main loop to terminate, printing a "Goodbye!" message.

### Copilot's Action
Refactored Program.cs in PriorityTaskManager.CLI to implement a menu-driven interactive CLI for manual CRUD testing. Added helper methods for each menu option and ensured clean separation of logic. The CLI now allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks interactively.
